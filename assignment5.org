* Key Generator
** It generates a software activatin ket based on the username and number of days its valid. 
** we are given a disassembled code.
** Task is to reverse the key-generator basesd on the given disassembled code
** And retrive the number of days.
*** The disassembly.cs file is the disassembled code
*** The key generator works when we click the create product key button.
*** It calls the buttonCreateProductKey_Click() 
*** It return concatination if 2 strings Ssout and str2
*** Through the initial variable declarations we can see that the int32 fetches the days from textboxDays. 
*** The final appended part str2 is a modified version of int32
*** we can see that Dor and Tor are two functions that are used to modify int32.
 
*** Throught final product key we know the str2 value (wymddd)
*** Lets reverse engineer by following throught the code.
*** Starting with DoR
**** Its converting the characters to lower case at the end.
**** So WYMDDD would be charArray value
**** For each of the character it went throught the for loop and increased by 1 unsigned value.
**** So lets decrease the characters by 1 position.
**** It would be VXLCCC
**** Before that if reversed the string. So let's revert back
**** It would be CCCLCV
**** This value is what entered into the DoR. 
**** Let's now see what went through ToR
**** All it dud was append values based on the value range of days.
**** Based on the letter CCCLCV we can looki through those conditions and figure the integer values.
**** 365 would the days which resulted in the output wymddd
