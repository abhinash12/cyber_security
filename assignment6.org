* Cracking binaries using Radare2
** Started by downloading the crackme.bin file
** Ran the file in radare2 using r2 ./crackme.bin
** aaa? listed the
** afl lists all the functions 
** pd displays the print disambelly
** we follow through the code and if want to seek the current address we use s
** s <function_name> to seek to particular function

** Regarding the crackme.bin binary started with the main function.
** Looked for the funciton calls in afl
** Then seeked to entr1.init function s entr1.init
***  pd //to print the disambely
*** Found nothing interesting here
** afl //listed all functions again
*** s main // seek to main
*** pd //print the disambelly
*** Found the mov qword str interesting 
*** SuperSekretKet word is used there
*** Tried SuperSekretKey in ./ vrackme.bin
*** It worked and bypasses the first password.
** Moving on to the second one
*** Again looked through the function calls and code flow.
*** After trying few random things in vain, based on further instructions in class presentation realized it would be random number each time for 2nd password.
*** Followed through by changing the code flow.
*** When the second funcion comparision is being doing moved the address bypassing that.
*** Go throught the write mode r2 -Aw
*** found the address it needs to jump.
*** s 0x00400919 //seek to that address
*** wa jmp 0x00400096a //jumps to that address
*** That helped to get through the second password
