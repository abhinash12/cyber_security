* Downloaded the tmpserver.cgi.zip from the given link
* extracted the file to tmpwserver.cgi
* Tried running the tmpserver.cgi file
** error while loading the shared libraries
** Tried fixing that didnt seem to work
** Looked to install the libgcc library, didn't wokr 
** Decided to move on see the binary to learn anything from that
* Opened the binary file with r2
**  r2 ./tmpserver.cgi
*** Started with address [0x00401050]
*** Printed disambely using pd
*** aaa
*** listed all the function using afl
*** started with main// s main
*** printed disambelly // pd
*** we can see a call instruction with a push instruction to jump to win function
*** looked throught the win function.
*** from there instead of returning the to main function we return the win function to the addr 0x0040116b
***  then we utilize the get string call.
*** use the python shell script to by pass that and we call find the flag tuck in the binary.
*** It is flag{h3llo W0rld}
