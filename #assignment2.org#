* System administration and system hardening.

** Went throught nsa/guides. Seemed pretty bulku and so didn't exactly know where and how to start. Later shifted to Using google to search for something when got stuck. 

* Created Assigments directory in git hub.

* Moved my old assignment file assignment1 to new directory.

* Assignment 2 Rubric

** Network

*** Reviewed the network config

*** Relied on goofle to look for network config files

*** Tried looking at /etc/network/ interfaces/

*** Then when on to look at hosts in /etc/ hosts file

*** As sugggested tried connecting to google.com through the browser.

*** Not succesfull

*** Found that in the /etc/ hosts file there is line with ip and www.google.com next to that.

*** In Hosts file we can Associate Ip addresses with hostnames 

*** And the ip addresses that is associated with google.com isn't the correct one.

*** Commented that line and saved the file

*** Tried connecting to google.com and it worked succesfully.

** Firewall

*** This allows us to block the access to the programs from others in the network or internet in general.

*** iptables -L listed the firewall rules

*** iptables.config is the place where we can define the access control rules.

*** We use the filter rulers here.

*** Did'nt make much changes here.

*** By defualt ubuntu uses a uncomplicated firewall(ufw).

** User/Permissions

*** This is where we define which all users can use the system.

*** We could limit the permission for user depending on read/write access individually.

*** ls -l <name> lists the permisiions of the file or directory

*** We could add new users by useradd <name_of_the_user>

*** Delete the users by deluser <name>

*** /etc/ passwd file has the list of all users and their permissions.

*** Found suspicous user by the name hacker.

*** Tried delecting the user by using userdel hacker.

*** But that user is currently running process and it says can't delete a user while the process is running.

*** So had to kill that processes first and deleted the user later.

*** Other strategies for dealing this could be to see what all processes he was running and rather than deleting him, we could restrict his permissions and observe his actions.

** Logs

*** Log file contains the record of all the actions that takes place with timestamps.

*** /var/log/ has the list of all sorts of log files recorded.

*** /var/log/ messages has all the system related stuff and general messages.

*** /var/log/ auth.log has the authentication logs. who all manages to login to the system and  at what time.

*** simillarly /vat/log/kern.log has the kernel logs

*** There are many other log files. Didn't venture into them.

*** We can always come back and study the log files to gain some insight as to what happend and when it has happened.

*** UserId, time and date, files and network access could be some of things we might want to check when suspicious or during an incident.

** Processes

*** We can find the list of all the processes that are currently running.

*** ps -A would give us all the processes. pstree would give us tree structured list all processes and sub-processes.

*** Top command would give us a nice detailed version of process with resources its utilizing (cpu, ,mem, time etc)

*** Based on this we can find suspicious processes that are draining the resources or taking too much computing.

*** We can kill those process using their processID

*** We use kill -15 <process_id> command to kill processes.

*** I have already killed processes earlier while tryin to delete the user hacker.
